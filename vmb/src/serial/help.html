<H2>Serial Operation</H2>
The program will contact the motherboard at [host:]port
and register itself with the given address and interrupt.
It will then connect to a serial port on the host computer
and forward send and receive data between the host serial device
and the virtual serial device.
<p>
The Serial Device can be used to connect a real serial device
to the virtual bus or, using a (real or virtual) null-modem,
it can be used to connect the host computer to the virtual bus,
thus providing a serial connection between the host computer 
and the virtual computer.

The tty (Unix) or the COM port (Windows) is configurable (see below).
Under Unix, virtual null modems are called pseudo ttys and can be
found in /dev/pty as pairs of master and slave devices that ar connected
pairwise. Under Windows, the program com0com (see
<a href="http://com0com.sourceforge.net/">com0com.sourceforge.net</a>
can be used to create a virtual null-modem.

<H3>Input</H3>
At offset 0, the serial device will provide a read only octabyte
in the following format:
<p>
EE00 00CC 0000 00DD
<p>
The EE byte signals errors. It will be 0x80 if an error occured
(making the octabyte negativ) and 0x00 otherwise.
<p>
The CC byte contains a count of the characters read from 
the input since the last read operation.  This should be 0
if no new character was received and 1 if one charcter was
received. Any other value will indicate that characters were
lost since the last read operation.
<p>
The DD byte contains the last character received. It is valid only
if CC is not zero.
<p>
The full ocatbyte will be reset to zero after reading the DD byte.
<p>
Reading a CC byte equal to zero means there is no DD byte avalable.
If the read interrupt is enabled, reading a zero CC value, 
will cause generation of a read interrupt as soon as CC becomes non zero.
If the application does not read CC, there will be no read interrupts.
<p>
<H3>Output</H3>
At offset 8, the serial device will provide a read/write octabyte
in the following format:
<p>
EE00 00CC 0000 00DD
<p>
The EE byte signals errors. It will be 0x80 if an error occured
(making the octabyte negativ) and 0x00 otherwise.
<p>
<p>
The CC byte contains a count of the characters written to DD since
the last output from the serial device was completed.
This should be 0 if DD is ready to receive a character 
or 1 if the (virtual) hardware is bussy with writing the DD byte.
Any other value will indicate that characters were
lost since the last write operation.
<p>
The DD byte contains the last character written to DD.
It is valid only if CC is non zero.
<p>
The full ocatbyte will be reset to zero after sending of the DD byte
completes.
<p>
Reading a CC byte equal to zero means you can write one byte to DD to
send output. If the write interrupt is enabled, 
reading a non zero CC value, will cause generation of a
write interrupt as soon as CC is returning to zero.
If the application does not read CC, there will be no write interrupts.

<H2>Serial Configuration</H2>
The serial device has the following configurable parameters:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr> <td>host      <td> localhost <td>the host where the bus is located </tr>
<tr> <td>port      <td> 9002 <td> the port where the bus is located</tr>
<tr> <td>address   <td> default <td> address where the resource is located </tr>
<tr> <td>rinterrupt <td> default <td>read interrupt send by device  </tr>
<tr> <td>winterrupt <td> default <td>write interrupt send by device  </tr>
<tr> <td>rdisable  <td> false <td> disable read interrupts </tr>
<tr> <td>wdisable  <td> false <td> disable write interrupts  </tr>
<tr> <td>serial    <td>       <td> connect to the given serial device </tr>
<tr> <td> x        <td> 0<td>the x position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> y        <td> 0<td>the y position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> minimized<td> false<td>start with a minimized window </tr>
<tr> <td> debug    <td> false<td>to generate debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> debugmask <td> 0xFFF0 <td>set mask to hide debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> verbose  <td> false<td>make debugging verbose, sets debug mask to zero </tr>
<tr> <td> define   <td> not set<td>to define a name for conditionals</tr>
<tr> <td> config   <td> not set<td>filename for a configuration file</tr>
<tr> <td> help     <td> false<td>to print information</tr>
</table>
These an be set on the command line or in configuration file.
