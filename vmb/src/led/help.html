<H1>LED Device Specification</H1>

The LED device offers just one byte of memory. Each bit of the byte corresponding to
one of 8 LEDs: Led0 through Led7. Led0 corresponds to the least significant bit (0x01) and 
Led7 corresponds to the most significant bit (0x80).
<p>
Seting a bit to 1 turns the led on, setting a bit to 0 turns the led off.
<p>
The number of leds displayed can be set to any value n between 1 and 8,
showing them from left to right Led(n-1) to Led0.


<H2>LED Configuration</H2>
