<H1>winvram Device Specification</H1>


<H2>The Video Ram</H2>
The video ram uses 4 Byte (one TETRA) for each pixel: II RR GG BB
The high order byte II is ignored, the next byte RR specifies the red value
in the range 0 (black) to 255 (full red), then GG the green and finally in the low order byte BB
the blue value - again in the range 0 to 255.
<p>
The first TETRA belongs to the top left pixel. The second TETRA to the next pixel
just to the right of it. Line by line from top to bottom, each TETRA in memory 
belongs to one pixel. The size of the video ram depends on the configuration.
The default gives a frame buffer 640 pixel wide and 480 Pixel high. Other sizes
are possible. It is possible to configure the visible size smaller than the
size of the frame buffer; this leaves video ram, that is not visible (off screen 
video ram). It can be used to store bitmaps. These can be transfered to the visible
part very fast using the GPU.


<H2>The Mouse device</H2>

The Mouse device uses 16 Byte that are read-only.

<p>
The first 4 Byte (0-4) contain the command. Writing any of these
bytes will trigger the execution of the command.
The command may be split into a command number (byte 0) and some
auxiliary information (1-3).
The command number (byte 0) also serves as status byte. 
The most significant bit is an error indicator. Therefore reading a
negativ status byte, indicates that an error has occured during the last operation.
Reading the status byte will reset the error indicator. So reading
the status byte twice will return a nonnegative value the second time
(unless a new error has occured between the first and the second read).
A zero status byte indicates that the GPU is idle and ready to receive
new commands. A positive status byte indicates that the GPU is 
bussy. The values are device dependent.
While the GPU is bussy, the effect of writing to the command byte is
unspecified. You can, however, write to (or read from) all the other GPU registers.
The values in the other registers will be used only when a GPU command
starts executing.
<p>
Most commands require a position. The coordinates are either taken
from Bytes 4,5 (x) and 6,7 (y) or 
from Bytes c,d (cur_x) and e,f (cur_y) (the current position).  
If appropriate,  executing a command will update the values cur_x and cur_y 
to make the current position work like a cursor.
<p>
Bit Block transfers from/to non graphic memory need a physical
target address. The address goes in the third OCTA, the bit block address (bba).
<p>
Some commands require, in addition, color information (Drawing of Text,
Lines and Rectangles) this information comes in the fourth and fifth OCTA.
<p>
Commands that need new x, y information would primarily use byte 4 to 7.
Alternatively the current x,y can be used. Width and height information 
can be provided in bytes 8, 9 (w) and 0xa, 0xb (w).
<p>
The sixth and seventh OCTA are read only. They provide information
on the size of the system font, the frame size and the visible part of it.
<p>
<H3>Commands</H3>
<H4> command == 0 Do Nothing</H4>

<H4> command == 1 Write Character</H4>
Write the character contained in the low byte of command aux (ASCII) to the current position
given in cur_x and cur_y using the system font. Update cur_x and cur_y for the next character.
Handle newline (0x0A) by moving cur_x, cur_y to the beginning of the next line and 
carriage return (0x0D) by moving cur_x, cur_y to the beginning of the current line.
Scroll up the screen, if a newline happens to be in the last line of the screen.

<H4> command == 2 Draw Rectangle</H4>
Draw a filled Rectangle using the fill color, using the x, y position as top left
and w,h as the size of the rectangle. No update of the position occurs.

<H4> command == 3 Draw Line</H4>
Draw a line, using the current line color, 
from the cur_x, cur_y position to the new x, y position.
The new x, y will then replace the current position cur_x, cur_y to support drawing joint lines.
If command aux is zero, the default line width is used (usually 1 pixel). If command aux
is not zero, it will be used as the line width in pixel.

<H4> command == 4 Bit Block Transfer</H4>
Transfers a rectangular block of pixels from one part of the video ram to another part
of the video ram.  The new position x,y is the top left coordinate of the source. 
The current position cur_x, cur_y is the top left coordinate of 
the destination; the width and height values w, h define the size of the destination rectangle.
Clipping (if needed) occurs on the destination rectangle.
The command aux value is used for the raster mode used in a
windows Bitblt Function. the following values are defined:

<H4> command == 5 Incoming Bit Block Transfer</H4> 
Transfers a rectangular block of pixels from regular memory into the video memory.
The bit block address (bba) is the physical address where
the source bit pattern is stored as a sequence of TETRA byte.
The current position cur_x, cur_y is the top left coordinate of 
the destination; the width and height values (w, h) define the size 
of source and destination rectangle.
Clipping (if needed) occurs on the destination rectangle.
The command aux value should be used for the raster mode as specified above,
(however this is currently not implemented). 
The values are just copied from source to destination.
<p>
The GPU will raise an interrupt when the data transfer has completed.
<p>

<H4> command == 6 Outgoing Bit Block Transfer</H4> 
Transfers a rectangular block of pixels from the video memory into regular memory.
The current position cur_x, cur_y is the top left coordinate of 
the source. The width and height values (w, h) define the size of the 
source and destination rectangle.
The bit block address (bba) is the physical address of the  destination where
the bit pattern is stored as a sequence of TETRA byte.

The command aux value should be used for the raster mode as specified above,
however, this is currently not implemented. 
The values are just copied from source to destination.
<p>
The GPU will raise an interrupt when the data transfer has completed.
