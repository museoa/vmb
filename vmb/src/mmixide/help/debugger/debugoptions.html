	<h3>The MMIX Debugger Options</h3>
	<p><img src="debugoptions.jpg" alt="" height="433" width="555" border="0"></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>You reach the MMIX debugger options through the Options menu.
	</p>
	<h4>Inspecting Registers and Memory</h4>
	In the two boxes on top of the dialog, you can select windows that 
	should open automatically when you start the debugger. 
	In the example above, the window showing the local registers and the 
	register stack will open; further a windows showing the Data Segment 
	and one showing the Pool Segment. All the other windows, for example 
	one for the global registers, can be opened manually when needed.
	<h4>Choosing Special Registers for display<img src="specialregs.jpg" alt="" height="837" width="338" align="right" hspace="20"></h4>
	<p>
	Next to the checkbox for the special registers is a Choose button. 
	Pressing it opens a dialog where you can choose which registers to 
	display in the special register window. Depending on the problem you 
	are trying to debug, some registers may be relevant and others not at 
	all. Only the registers selected here will be shown in the special 
	register window.
	</p>
	<h4>Customizing Tracing</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Show Trace: If the checkbox is selected, the trace window will open and 
	a detailed trace of the instructions is printed when the program stops or hits 
	a tracepoint. Otherwise, the program will run silent.
	<p>
	<li>Break at Main: If theis checkbox is selected, a breakpoint is 
		added automaticaly at <tt>Main</tt>. So it will stop as soon as it 
		enters the Main program.
		<P>
		<li>Break after instruction or before instruction: Here you can 
		select whether the program stops before or after executing the 
		instruction. This applies to breakpoints as well as to single stepping. 
		<p>
			The &quot;classic&quot; behaviour of the MMIX debuger is to 
			stop after the instruction, so that you can see in the trace 
			what the instruction just has done.
			<p>
			Other source code debuggers (for example gdb) usualy stop 
			before executing the instruction. This has the advantage, that you can inspect registers and memory before the instruction, that advance the program to the next instruction and see the changes. It can also be convenient to stop at a branch instruction before it gets executet and then see where it will take the machine.
