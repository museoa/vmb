<h2>The MMIX Debugger</h2>
If an MMIX source file is in the editor, you can start
the MMIX simulator in debugging mode 
either by
<ul> 
<li> Selecting "Debug" from the "MMIX" menu.
<li> Pressing the F5 key.
<li> Pressing the Debugg/Continue Button <font color="gray"><img src="debug.gif" alt="" height="24" width="24" border="2"></font>.
</ul>

If the source file has changed, you will be asked if you want
to save your changes.
Then you will be asked whether you want to assemble the source file
(unless the mmo file on disk is newer than the source file.)
Running the assembler will also collect information about
connecting the lines and symbols in your source file to locations
in memory. This infomation is necessary while debugging. 
If the assembler has finished without errors, debugging will start.

	<p>
Once the debugger has started a collection of new buttons is displayed
in the button bar. These buttons are a more convenient alternative to
the commands that you find in the MMIX menu.

	
	<p></p>
	<p>You can further customize the debuggers behaviour through the Debug Options dialog, which you can access through the Options menu.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h4>Running, Stopping, and Stepwise Execution</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="debug.gif" alt="" height="24" width="24" border="2"> </font>Debugg/Continue<br>
			Continue execution instructions until a breakpoint or the end
of the Program is reached.
			<p>
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="stepin.gif" border=2></font> Step Instruction<br>
Execute one instruction and stop again.
<p>
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="stepover.gif" border=2></font> Step Over<br> 
Like Step Instruction, unless the current instruction is a 
<tt>PUSHJ</tt> or <tt>PUSHGO</tt> instruction. In this case run
the program without stopping until the corresponding <tt>POP</tt> 
instruction is executed (unless a breakpoint or the end of the program intervenes).
<p>
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="stepout.gif" border=2></font> Step Out<br>
			Continue execution until the end of the current subroutine 
			(unless a breakpoint or the end of the program intervenes).
			<p>
		
		
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="pause.gif" border=2></font> Break Execution<br>
			Interrupt a running execution, as if a breakpoint was hit.
			<p>
		
		<li><font color="gray"><img src="stop.gif" border=2></font> Halt Execution<br>
			Terminate the debugging session.<p>
		</ul>
	
<h4>Setting Breakpoints and Tracepoints</h4>There are three buttons to toggle (set or unset) breakpoints and one button to toggle a tracepoint. To set a breakpoint move the cursor in the edit window to the line containing the instruction and press the appropriate button.<ul>
		<li><img src="brkexec.gif" border=0> toggle an execute breakpoint. The program will stop after or before executing the first instruction on this line.<br>
			<p>
			Execute breakpoint exampe:<font color="gray"><img src="execline.gif" align="absmiddle" border=2 hspace="20"></font>
			<p>
		    You can toggle execute breakpoint also directly by clicking with the mouse in the margin.
		    <p>
		<li><img src="brkread.gif" border=0> toggle a read breakpoint. The program will stop after any read access to this memory location.
			<p>
			Read breakpoint exampe:<font color="gray"><img src="readline.gif" align="absmiddle" border=2 hspace="20"></font>
			<p>
		<li><img src="brkwrite.gif" border=0> toggle a write breakpoint. The program will stop after any write access to this memory location.
			<p>
			Read and write breakpoint exampe:<font color="gray"><img src="rwriteline.gif" align="absmiddle" border=2 hspace="20"></font>
			<p>
		<li><img src="brktrace.gif" border=0> toggle a tracepoint. This instruction will be shown in the trace window each time it is executed.
			<p>
			Tracepoint exampe:<font color="gray"><img src="traceline.gif" align="absmiddle" border=2 hspace="20"></font>
			<p>
	</ul>
