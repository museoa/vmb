	<h3>The MMIX Debugger Options</h3>
	<p><img src="debugoptions.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>You reach the MMIX debugger options through the Options menu.
	</p>
	<h4>Inspecting Registers and Memory</h4>In the two boxes on top of the dialog, you can select windows that should open automatically when you start the debugger. In the example above, the window showing the local registers and the register stack will open; further a windows showing the Data Segment. All the other windows, for example one for the global registers, can be opened manually when needed.<h4>Choosing Special Registers for display<img src="specials.png" alt="" align="right" hspace="20"></h4>
	<p>
	Next to the checkbox for the special registers is a Choose button. 
	Pressing it opens a dialog where you can choose which registers to 
	display in the special register window. Depending on the problem you 
	are trying to debug, some registers may be relevant and others not at 
	all. Only the registers selected here will be shown in the special 
	register window.
	</p>
	<h4>Customizing Tracing</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Show Trace: <br>
			If the checkbox is selected, the trace window will open and a detailed trace of the instructions is printed when the program stops or hits a tracepoint. Otherwise, the program will run silent.
			<p>
	<li>Break at Main: <br>
			If this checkbox is selected, a breakpoint is added automaticaly 
			at <tt>Main</tt>. So the program will stop as soon as it enters the 
			Main program.
			<P>
	<li>Break after instruction: or<br>
	<li>Break before instruction:<br> 
			Here you can select whether the program stops before or 
			after executing the instruction. 
			This applies to breakpoints as well as to single stepping.
			<p>
			The &quot;classic&quot; behaviour of the MMIX debuger is to 
			stop after the instruction, so that you can see in the trace 
			what the instruction just has done.
			<p>
			Other source code debuggers (for example gdb) usualy stop 
			before executing the instruction. This has the advantage, 
			that you can inspect registers and memory before the instruction, 
			that advance the program to the next instruction and see the changes. 
			It can also be convenient to stop at a branch instruction before it 
			gets executet and then see where it will take the machine.
			<P>
    <li>Enable stack tracing:<br>
    If this box is checked, the trace will show details of the hidden register stack
     while tracing. This is equivalent to the -r option of the mmix simulator.
     <p>
	<li>Trace exceptions:<img src="exceptions.jpg" alt="" height="279" width="375" align="right" border="0" hspace="20"><br>
			If this boy is checked, all instructions that cause an arithmetic 
			exception will be shown in the trace. This is equivalent to the -e 
			option of the mmix simulator. 
			<p>
			If this box is unchecked, no such information is given. 
			<p>
			If the box is shaded, a subset of the eight possible arithmetic 
			exceptions has be selected for tracing. To change the set of traced 
			exceptions press the Choose button to the right. A window will open 
			that lets you select or deselect the various arithmetic exceptions 
			for tracing.
			<p>
	<li>Warn if no application:<br>
	If this box is checked, the debugger will issue a warning message 
	when you try to start a program, but no file is selected for loading into memory.
	To select a file for loading, or change this selection use the <a href="sources.html">Sources Dialog Box</a>.
	<p>
	<li> The Auto-Close feature for the debug windows is not yet implemented.
	</ul>
