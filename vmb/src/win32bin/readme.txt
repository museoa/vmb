Introduction:
=============
The virtual motherboard is an implementation of an open
specification of a virtual bus. The documentation as 
well as the code is maintained at vmb.sourceforge.net

Getting Started:
================
After installing the binaries, you should be able to 
doubleclick the readme.vmb file on your desktop to see 
this readme file. The best way to get startet, however, 
is downloading one of the extended examples available 
at mmix.cs.hm.edu.
