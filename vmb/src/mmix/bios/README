The BIOS development was moved from the rom subdirectory to
the bios subdirectory of the mmix subdirectory.
It is mmix specific!

It contains different bios variations
that can be generated using the Makefile

Here is a list of subdirectories and a short description

plain
-----
contains a plain selfcontained bios.mms file
that is made into an mmo file using the standard mmixal
and than made into an imagefile using mmoboot (from the mmix directory)

simple
------
contains a simple bios.s file equivalent to the plain
bios. This bios is however split in separate files
and the gnu binutils are used to make the bios.img file
