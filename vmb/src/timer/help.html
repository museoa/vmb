<H2>Timer Interrupts</H2>
The timer uses 4 Byte (one TETRA) at the configured address 
to specify a timer interval n in
milliseconds (1/1000 second).
<p>
If the timer interval is set to a value n, where n is not zero,
the timer will wait n milliseconds and then send an interrupt
with a configuarble interupt number. Then the timer will wait
again and send further interrupts
<p>
If the timer interval is set while the timer is already waiting,
the waiting period will start over from zero.
<p>
If the timer interval is set to zero, there will be no further
interrupts.

<H2>Current Time (Win32 version only)</H2>
The values y, m, d, w, t specify the current time
and date as given by the host operating system.
These values are read only.

<H2>Timer Configuration</H2>
The timer has the following configuarble parameters:
<p>
<table>
<tr> <td>host      <td> localhost <td>the host where the bus is located </tr>
<tr> <td>port      <td> 9002 <td> the port where the bus is located</tr>
<tr> <td>address   <td> default <td> address where the resource is located </tr>
<tr> <td>interrupt <td> default <td>interrupt send by device  </tr>
<tr> <td> x        <td> 0<td>the x position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> y        <td> 0<td>the y position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> minimized<td> false<td>start with a minimized window </tr>
<tr> <td> debug    <td> false<td>to generate debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> verbose  <td> false<td>make debugging verbose </tr>
<tr> <td> define   <td> not set<td>to define a name for conditionals</tr>
<tr> <td> config   <td> not set<td>filename for a configuration file</tr>
<tr> <td> help     <td> false<td>to print information</tr>
</table>
These should be set in default.mmc
