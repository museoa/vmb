<H2>Current Time and Date</H2>
The values y, m, d, dst, yd, wd, h, m, s, ms specify the current time
and date as given by the host operating system.
These values are read only.

<H2>Timer Interrupts</H2>
The timer uses the interval i and offset t (both in milliseconds)
to specify timer interrupts. If t is set to a non-zero value, the timer
will wait t milliseconds  and then raise an interrupt.
If at the time of the interrupt i has a non-zero value, the interrupt will 
be repeated i milliseconds later again (until i is set to zero).
<p>
If the timer offset t is set while the timer is already waiting,
the waiting period will start over from zero to the new value of t.
<p>
If the timer offset t is set to zero, there will be no further
interrupts.
<p>
Reading the timer offset t will return zero, if there is no interrupt pending. It will return a nonzero value if there is an interrupt pending. The value will not reflect the time remaining until the interrupt occurs but the value last written to t. To obtain the remaining time you should read t0 and dt (see below) and compare the result with the value read from ms.
<p>
Reading the timer interval i will return a nonzero value if the inerrupt will repeat after it ist raised. It will return zero if there is only a single (or none) interrupt in the future.
<p> 
If the timer interval i is set to a different value, this change will have
an effect only at the time the next interrupt occurs.
<p>
The values t0 and dt are an alternative way to specify t. Setting t will
automatically set t0 and dt, while setting t0 and/or dt will automatically
set t.
<p>
Storing a nonzero value to either t0 or dt will cause the timer device to
wait until the absolute time ms reaches the value t0+dt and then raise an
interrupt. Setting t0 and/or dt is (almost) the same as setting t to t0+dt-ms.
<p>
There is a slight difference between the use of t and of t0/dt.
An interrupt will occur immediately if t0+dt is less or equal 
to ms (a time in the past).  
Storing to t0/dt can therefore not be used to disable or stop interrupts.
For this  purpose store zero to t (t is always in the future).
<p>
In the other direction, storing a nonzero value to t is 
the same as storing ms to t0 and t to dt.
<p>
The use of t0 and dt, is necessary if repeated use of the timer should not
result in a timer drift. If, for example, an interrupt is needed at the beginning
of every second and 10 millisecond after the full second, using the timer interval
is not efficient. Using just the offset t will cause the timer to slowly
drift because of the computation needed between sending the interrupt and reseting
it again. In this case, the application should read ms at the very beginning
of the program keeping the value in a local base variable. Then it can call for 
the first interrupts at t0=base, dt=1000 a second later. The next interrupt is then
requested at t0=base+1000, dt=10. Further interrupts are called for at
t0=base+1010, dt=990; t0=base+2000,dt=10; ...
The time to reschedule the interrupt will not cause a timer drift, since the time
of the interrupt is specified as an absolute time.

<H2>Timer Configuration</H2>
The timer has the following configurable parameters:
<p>
<table>
<tr> <td>host      <td> localhost <td>the host where the bus is located </tr>
<tr> <td>port      <td> 9002 <td> the port where the bus is located</tr>
<tr> <td>address   <td> default <td> address where the resource is located </tr>
<tr> <td>interrupt <td> default <td>interrupt send by device  </tr>
<tr> <td> x        <td> 0<td>the x position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> y        <td> 0<td>the y position of the window </tr>
<tr> <td> minimized<td> false<td>start with a minimized window </tr>
<tr> <td> debug    <td> false<td>to generate debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> verbose  <td> false<td>make debugging verbose </tr>
<tr> <td> define   <td> not set<td>to define a name for conditionals</tr>
<tr> <td> config   <td> not set<td>filename for a configuration file</tr>
<tr> <td> help     <td> false<td>to print information</tr>
</table>
These should be set in default.mmc
Later versions of the timer device might specify a resolution, to change
the units of ms, t, i, t0 an dt. Currently, only a millisecond timer is available.

<tr><th>Byte<th>Mode<th>Name<th>Description
<tr><td>00-03<td>RW<td>n<td> number of milliseconds to wait
<tr><td>04-07<td>R <td>y<td> current year
<tr><td>08-09<td>R <td>m<td> current month (0 = January, 1 = February, ... , 11 = December)

<H2>Timer Interrupts</H2>
The timer uses 4 Byte (one TETRA) at the configured address 
to specify a timer interval n in
milliseconds (1/1000 second).
<p>
If the timer interval is set to a value n, where n is not zero,
the timer will wait n milliseconds and then send an interrupt
with a configurable interrupt number. Then the timer will wait
again and send further interrupts
<p>
If the timer interval is set while the timer is already waiting,
the waiting period will start over from zero.
<p>
If the timer interval is set to zero, there will be no further
interrupts.

<H2>Current Time (Win32 version only)</H2>
The values y, m, d, w, t specify the current time
and date as given by the host operating system.
These values are read only.

<H2>Timer Configuration</H2>
The timer has the following configurable parameters:
<p>
<table>
<tr> <td>host      <td> localhost <td>the host where the bus is located </tr>
<tr> <td>port      <td> 9002 <td> the port where the bus is located</tr>
<tr> <td>address   <td> default <td> address where the resource is located </tr>
<tr> <td>interrupt <td> default <td>interrupt send by device  </tr>
<tr> <td> x        <td> 0<td>the x position of the window </tr>

<tr> <td> define   <td> not set<td>to define a name for conditionals</tr>
<tr> <td> config   <td> not set<td>filename for a configuration file</tr>
<tr> <td> help     <td> false<td>to print information</tr>
</table>
These should be set in default.mmc
