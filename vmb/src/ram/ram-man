.SH DESCRIPTION
This module simulates one ram module on a motherboard for the mmix mb Simulator.
There are three Interrupts where the ram reacts:

	The "Power On" is needed for initiating the ram the first time.
	On an Power off (which is the same interrupt like Power fail) the content of the ram will be deleted and new initialized.
	After that the ram will wait until an "Power On" comes from the motherboard.
	On an "Reboot" the ram only deletes its memory and reinitializes it.

Internally the ram module gets from the bus an address to read from or to write to. The module
calculates an 32 Bit ofset from this address. (This will be the address to read/write - address where the ram starts)
the first 10 bits are the index for the high index table of the ram,
the following 10 bits are the index for the low index table of the ram,
and the last 12 bits are needed to address blocks of 4kbyte.
Each entry of the high index table will point to an different low index table, in the low index table
there are pointers to the single blocks. After initiating no blocks and no low index tables will be
created, only if you write to an address for which no low index table and/or no block exists, they will be
created.
On an read operation, to an address, where no low index table or no block exists, it will be returned zero
bytes.
