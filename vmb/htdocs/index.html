<H1> The Virtual Motherboard Homepage</H1>

The Virtual Motherboard is hosted under sourceforge
(see: <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/</A>). There you can get
source code and browse the CVS repository.
<p>
Here you find documents, specifications for individual devices
and links to ready to run binary examples.

<H2> Examples </H2>

<H3><A HREF="http://math.cs.hm.edu/vmb/example1">Example 1</A></H3>
A simple configuration running under Linux consisting of
<UL>
<LI> Virtual Motherboard.
<LI> MMIX CPU
<LI> ROM, including the rom image and the MMIX source files for the image
<LI> RAM
<LI> Screen
<LI> Keyboard
<LI> A sample hello world program, written in MMIX assembler.
<LI> The mmix assembler (mmixal) and a tool to produce a boot image
     from an mmix object file (mmoboot).
<LI> A README file.
<LI> The configuration file (default.mmc).
<LI> A tgz file containing all of the above.
</UL>

			<UL>
				<LI> Virtual Motherboard.


				<LI> MMIX CPU

				<LI> ROM, including the rom image and the MMIX source files for the image

				<LI> RAM

				<LI> Two Framebuffer devices, one written in Java the other in C (for X11).

				<LI> A sample program lorenz.mms diplaying a lorenz attractor.

			<H3><A HREF="http://math.cs.hm.edu/vmb/example3">Example 3</A></H3>
The same as Example 1, but with executables for WIN32.

				<H3><A HREF="http://math.cs.hm.edu/vmb/example4">Example 4</A></H3>
The same as Example 2, but with executables for WIN32.
					<H3><A HREF="http://math.cs.hm.edu/vmb/example5">Example 5</A></H3>
This example demonstrates a simple embedded device, a stopwatch.
There is no RAM (everything works in registers, no user program, just
a program in ROM.
						<p>
The example uses the GNU toolchain under windows to build the system.


						<UL>
							<LI> start it by double-clicking the motherboard. You will get the
motherboard, ROM (no RAM needed for this), a MMIX CPU in a console window,
a black, a green, and a red button, a timer, and a seven-segment display.
Arrange them on the screen as needed. At the first run all items are 
located at position 0x0, but they remember new positions...

							<LI> Power the system on using the power button on the motherboard.

							<LI> Pressing the green button sends an interrupt and the CPU will 
switch on the timer.

							<LI>  A Timer interrupt will come every 1/10th of a second.

							<LI> The CPU will update the display on receiving a timer interrupt.

							<LI> Pressing the red button will stop up the timer.

							<LI> Pressing the black button, will reset the counter to zero.

						</UL>
						<H3><A HREF="http://math.cs.hm.edu/vmb/example7">Example 7</A></H3>
This example demonstrates the framebuffer device, buttons and timer.
							<UL>
								<LI> The program runs the "Game of Live"

								<LI> start it by double-clicking the motherboard. You will get the
motherboard, RAM, ROM, am MMIX CPU in a console window, a black, green, and
red button, a timer, and a frame buffer device. Arrange them on the screen
as needed. At the first run all items are located at position 0x0, but they
remember new positions...

								<LI> When power is on the CPU starts, and initializes the screen.

								<LI> Pressing the green button sends an interrupt and the CPU will advance
to the next generation.

								<LI> Pressing the red button will set up the timer, to send interrupts,
advancing to the next generation automatically.

								<LI> Pressing the black button, will terminate the Game of Life program. And
the CPU returns to the operating systems idle loop.

								<LI> Press the rest button on the motherboard to start over.

							</UL>
							It should be possible to write a program that starts with zero
counting the seconds and displaying the number of seconds elapsed on
the seven segment display.
