.SH DESCRIPTION
Motherboard is part of the MMIX-MB project, which aims to provide an infrastructure for the MMIX processor
by Donald Knuth. The project provides protocols and software components to enable the assembly of MMIX CPU,
physical RAM, Serial I/O, Graphic Cards, ROM, Disks, Network Interfaces, etc... to a complete computing system.

The motherboard is extensible in the sense, that new simulators written for new hardware can be "plugged into" the
existing motherboard configuration to provide extended hardware capabilities.
New components can be detected at boot time/run time by the CPU and can be used by application programs after installing appropriate software drivers.

The motherboard provides the communication between all hardware components, implemented by separate processes, through a virtual data- and address bus,
and virtual interrupt lines. It defines a generic hardware interface, such that simulators for arbitrary hardware
components can be written and used together with the MMIX motherboard.
