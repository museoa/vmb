		<H2>Operation</H2>
		The program will contact the motherboard at [host:]port and register itself with the given address and interrupt. Then, the program will be ready to receive bytes and display them. Under Unix a Byte is displayed by sending it to the standard output. Whenever ready to receive a byte, it will signal an interrupt with the given interrupt number. At the given address it will provide a read/write octabyte in the format: given above.
		<p>The X byte signals errors. It will be 0x80 if an error occured and 0x00 otherwise. By setting the sign bit errors can be easily checked..</p>
		<p>The Y byte contains the number of characters that were written to this address since the last output. This should be 0 if the address is ready to receive a character or 1 if the hardware is bussy with writing a byte. Any other value will indicate that characters were lost since the last write operation.</p>
		<p>The Z byte contains the last character received. It is valid only if YY is not zero.</p>
		<p>The complete ocatbyte will be reset to zero after a byte is output..</p>
		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		The Screen has the following configurable parameters:
		<table>
<tr> <td>host      <td> localhost <td>the host where the bus is located </tr>
<tr> <td>port      <td> 9002 <td> the port where the bus is located</tr>
<tr> <td>address   <td> default <td> address where the resource is located </tr>
			<tr>
				<td>interrupt</td>
				<td>not set</td>
				<td>interrupt sent when ready</td>
			</tr>
			<tr> <td> x        <td> 0<td>the x position of the window </tr>
			<tr> <td> y        <td> 0<td>the y position of the window </tr>
			<tr> <td> minimized<td> false<td>start with a minimized window </tr>
			<tr> <td> debug    <td> false<td>to generate debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> debugmask <td> 0xFFF0 <td>set mask to hide debug output </tr>
<tr> <td> verbose  <td> false<td>make debugging verbose, sets debug mask to zero </tr>
<tr> <td> define   <td> not set<td>to define a name for conditionals</tr>
<tr> <td> config   <td> not set<td>filename for a configuration file</tr>
<tr> <td> help     <td> false<td>to print information</tr>
</table>
		<p>
These can be set in default.vmb
