                This instruction has no effect on registers or memory, but it informs the computer that many of the
                X + 1 bytes M[$Y + $Z] through M[$Y + $Z + X], or M[$Y + Z] through M[$Y + Z + X], will probably be
                loaded and/or stored in the near future. No protection failure occurs if the memory is not accessible.
            </td></tr>
        <tr><td>PREST:</td><td><i>"prestore data"</i><br><br>

                This instruction has no effect on registers or memory, but it informs the computer that many of the
                X + 1 bytes M[$Y + $Z] through M[$Y + $Z + X], or M[$Y + Z] through M[$Y + Z + X], will definitely be stored in the near future before they are loaded.
                (Therefore it is permissible for the machine to ignore the present contents of those bytes. Also, if those bytes
                are being shared by several processors, the current processor should try to acquire exclusive access.) No
                protection failure occurs if the memory is not accessible.

                This instruction has no effect on registers or memory, but it informs the computer that many of the
                X + 1 bytes M[$Y + $Z] through M[$Y + $Z + X], or M[$Y + Z] through M[$Y + Z + X], will probably be
                used as instructions in the near future. No protection failure occurs if the memory is not accessible.
