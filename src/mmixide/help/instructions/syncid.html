            <td><i>"Synchronize instructions and data"</i> <br>When executed from nonnegative locations these instructions have no effect on registers or memory if the
                computer has no instruction cache separate from a data cache. But when such a cache exists, they force the
                computer to make sure that the X + 1 bytes M[$Y + $Z] through M[$Y + $Z + X], or M[$Y + Z] through
                M[$Y +Z+X], will be interpreted correctly if used as instructions before they are next modified. (Generally
                speaking, an MMIX program is not expected to store anything in memory locations that are also being used
                as instructions. Therefore MMIX's instruction cache is allowed to become inconsistent with respect to its
                data cache. Programmers who insist on executing instructions that have been fabricated dynamically, for
                example when setting a breakpoint for debugging, must first SYNCID those instructions in order to guarantee
                that the intended results will be obtained.) A SYNCID command might be implemented in several ways; for
                example, the machine might update its instruction cache to agree with its data cache. A simpler solution,
                which is good enough because the need for SYNCID ought to be rare, removes instructions in the specified
                range from the instruction cache, if present, so that they will have to be fetched from memory the next time.</tr>
