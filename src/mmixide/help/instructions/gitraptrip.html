        Special register rA records the current status information about arithmetic
        exceptions. Its least significant byte contains eight "event" bits called DVWIOUZX from left to right,
        where D stands for integer divide check, V for integer overflow, W for float-to-fix overflow, I for invalid
        operation, O for floating overflow, U for floating underflow, Z for floating division by zero, and X for floating
        inexact. The next least significant byte of rA contains eight "enable" bits with the same names DVWIOUZX
        and the same meanings. When an exceptional condition occurs, there are two cases: If the corresponding
        enable bit is 0, the corresponding event bit is set to 1. But if the corresponding enable bit is 1, MMIX
        interrupts its current instruction stream and executes a special "exception handler." Thus, the event bits
        record exceptions that have not been "tripped."<br><br>
        Floating point overflow always causes two exceptions, O and X. (The strictest interpretation of the IEEE
        standard would raise exception X on overflow only if floating overflow is not enabled, but MMIX always
        considers an overflowed result to be inexact.) Floating point underflow always causes both U and X when
        underflow is not enabled, and it might cause both U and X when underflow is enabled. If both enable bits
        are set to 1 in such cases, the overflow or underflow handler is called and the inexact handler is ignored. All
        other types of exceptions arise one at a time, so there is no ambiguity about which exception handler should
        be invoked unless exceptions are raised by "ropcode 2" (see below); in general the first enabled exception in
        the list DVWIOUZX takes precedence.<br>
        What about the six high-order bytes of the status register rA? At present, only two of those 48 bits are
        defined; the others must be zero for compatibility with possible future extensions. The two bits corresponding
        to 2<sup>17</sup>
        and 2<sup>16</sup>
        in rA specify a rounding mode, as follows: 00 means round to nearest (the default); 01 means
        round off (toward zero); 10 means round up (toward positive infinity); and 11 means round down (toward
        negative infinity).

    <B id="waystointerrupt">Ways to interrupt</B>
    <p>
        The execution of MMIX programs can be interrupted in several ways. We have just seen that arithmetic
        exceptions will cause interrupts if they are enabled; so will illegal or privileged instructions, or instructions
        that are emulated in software instead of provided by the hardware. Input/output operations or external
        timers are another common source of interrupts; the operating system knows how to deal with all gadgets
        that might be hooked up to an MMIX processor chip. Interrupts occur also when memory accesses fail-for
        example if memory is nonexistent or protected. Power failures that force the machine to use its backup
        battery power in order to keep running in an emergency, or hardware failures like parity errors, all must be
        handled as gracefully as possible.
        Users can also force interrupts to happen by giving explicit TRAP or TRIP instructions:

    </p>
    <p>
    <table  border=1 cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
        <tr><td><a href="trap.html">TRAP</a> | <a href="trip.html">TRIP</a></td><td><i>"trap" | "trip"</i><br><br>Both of these instructions interrupt processing and transfer control to a handler. The difference between
                them is that TRAP is handled by the operating system but TRIP is handled by the user. More precisely, the
                X, Y, and Z fields of TRAP have special significance predefined by the operating system kernel. For example,
                a system call-say an I/O command, or a command to allocate more memory-might be invoked by certain
                settings of X, Y, and Z. The X, Y, and Z fields of TRIP, on the other hand, are definable by users for their
                own applications, and users also define their own handlers. "Trip handler" programs invoked by TRIP are
                interruptible, but interrupts are normally inhibited while a TRAP is being serviced. Specific details about the
                precise actions of TRIP and TRAP appear below, together with the description of another command called
                RESUME that returns control from a handler to the interrupted program.
                Only two variants of TRAP are predefined by the MMIX architecture: If XYZ = 0 in a TRAP command, a
                user process should terminate. If XYZ = 1, the operating system should provide default action for cases in
                which the user has not provided any handler for a particular kind of interrupt (see below).
                A few additional variants of TRAP are predefined in the rudimentary operating system used with MMIX
                simulators. These variants, which allow simple input/output operations to be done, all have X = 0, and the
                Y field is a small positive constant. For example, Y = 1 invokes the Fopen routine, which opens a file.

</p>
<p>
    Non-catastrophic interrupts in MMIX are always <i>precise</i>, in the sense that all legal instructions before a
    certain point have effectively been executed, and no instructions after that point have yet been executed. The
    current instruction, which may or may not have been completed at the time of interrupt and which may or
    may not need to be resumed after the interrupt has been serviced, is put into the special <i>execution register</i> rX,
    and its operands (if any) are placed in special registers rY and rZ. The address of the following instruction
    is placed in the special <i>where-interrupted register</i> rW. The instruction in rX might not be the same as the
    instruction in location rW - 4; for example, it might be an instruction that branched or jumped to rW. It
    might also be an instruction inserted internally by the MMIX processor. (For example, the computer silently
    inserts an internal instruction that increases L before an instruction like ADD $9,$1,$0 if L is currently less
    than 10. If an interrupt occurs, between the inserted instruction and the ADD, the instruction in rX will say
    ADD, because an internal instruction retains the identity of the actual command that spawned it; but rW
    will point to the real ADD command.)</p>
<p>
    When an instruction has the normal meaning "set $X to the result of $Y op $Z" or "set $X to the result
    of $Y op Z," special registers rY and rZ will relate in the obvious way to the Y and Z operands of the
    instruction; but this is not always the case. For example, after an interrupted store instruction, the first
    operand rY will hold the virtual memory address ($Y plus either $Z or Z), and the second operand rZ will
    be the octabyte to be stored in memory (including bytes that have not changed, in cases like STB). In other
    cases the actual contents of rY and rZ are defined by each implementation of MMIX, and programmers should
    not rely on their significance.</p>
<p>
    Some instructions take an unpredictable and possibly long amount of time, so it may be necessary to
    interrupt them in progress. For example, the FREM instruction (floating point remainder) is extremely
    difficult to compute rapidly if its first operand has an exponent of 2046 and its second operand has an
    exponent of 1. In such cases the rY and rZ registers saved during an interrupt show the current state of
    the computation, not necessarily the original values of the operands. The value of rY rem rZ will still be
    the desired remainder, but rY may well have been reduced to a number that has an exponent closer to the
    exponent of rZ. After the interrupt has been processed, the remainder computation will continue where it
    left off.<br> 
    Another example arises with an instruction like PREST (prestore), which can specify prestoring up to 256
    bytes. An implementation of MMIX might choose to prestore only 32 or 64 bytes at a time, depending on the
    cache block size; then it can change the contents of rX to reflect the unfinished part of a partially completed
    PREST command.<br> 
    Commands that decrease G, pop the stack, save the current context, or unsave an old context also are
    interruptible. Register rX is used to communicate information about partial completion in such a way that
    the interruption will be essentially "invisible" after a program is resumed.
</p>
<B id="listofinterrupts">Description of Interrupts</B>
<p>
    Three kinds of interruption are possible: trips, forced traps, and dynamic traps. We will discuss each
    of these in turn.</p>
<B id="trip">TRIP</B>
<p>
    A TRIP instruction puts itself into the right half of the execution register rX, and sets the 32 bits of the
    left half to
    #80000000. (Therefore rX is <i>negative</i>; this fact will tell the RESUME command not to TRIP again.)
    The special registers rY and rZ are set to the contents of the registers specfied by the Y and Z fields of the
    TRIP command, namely $Y and $Z. Then $255 is placed into the special <i>bootstrap register</i> rB, and $255 is
    set to rJ. MMIX now takes its next instruction from virtual memory address 0.</p>
<p>

    Arithmetic exceptions interrupt the computation in essentially the same way as TRIP, if they are enabled.
    The only difference is that their handlers begin at the respective addresses 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112,
    and 128, for exception bits D, V, W, I, O, U, Z, and X of rA; registers rY and rZ are set to the operands of
    the interrupted instruction as explained earlier.
    A 16-byte block of memory is just enough for a sequence of commands like</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
    <i><a href="pushj.html">PUSHJ</a> 255,Handler; <a href="put.html">PUT</a> rJ,$255; <a href="put.html">GET</a> $255,rB; <a href="resume.html">RESUME</a></i>
</p>
<p>
    which will invoke a user's handler. And if the user does not choose to provide a custom-designed handler,
    the operating system provides a default handler via the instructions</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <i><a href="trap.html">TRAP</a> 1; <a href="put.html">GET</a> $255,rB; <a href="resume.html">RESUME</a></i>
</p>
<p>
    A trip handler might simply record the fact that tripping occurred. But the handler for an arithmetic
    interrupt might want to change the default result of a computation. In such cases, the handler should
    place the desired substitute result into rZ, and it should change the most significant byte of rX from #80 to
    #02. This will have the desired effect, because of the rules of RESUME explained below, unless the exception
    occurred on a command like STB or STSF. (A bit more work is needed to alter the effect of a command that
    stores into memory.)</p>


<p>
    Instructions in negative virtual locations do not invoke trip handlers, either for TRIP or for arithmetic
    exceptions. Such instructions are reserved for the operating system, as we will see.
</p>
<B id="trap">FORCED TRAP</B>
<p>
    A TRAP instruction interrupts the computation essentially like TRIP, but with the following modifications:<br><br>
    (i) the interrupt mask register rK is cleared to zero, thereby inhibiting interrupts;<br> (ii) control jumps
    to virtual memory address rT, not zero;<br> (iii) information is placed in a separate set of special registers rBB,
    rWW, rXX, rYY, and rZZ, instead of rB, rW, rX, rY, and rZ. (These special registers are needed because
    a trap might occur while processing a TRIP.)<br><br>
    Another kind of forced trap occurs on implementations of MMIX that emulate certain instructions in
    software rather than in hardware. Such instructions cause a TRAP even though their opcode is something
    else like FREM or FADD or DIV. The trap handler can tell what instruction to emulate by looking at the
    opcode, which appears in rXX. In such cases the left-hand half of rXX is set to
    #02000000; the handler
    emulating FADD, say, should compute the floating point sum of rYY and rZZ and place the result in rZZ.
    A subsequent RESUME 1 will then place the value of rZZ in the proper register.

    When a forced trap occurs on a store instruction because of memory protection failure, the settings of
    rYY and rZZ are undefined. They do not necessarily correspond to the virtual address rY and the octabyte
    to be stored rZ that are supplied to a trip handler after a tripped store instruction, because a forced trap
    aborts its instruction as soon as possible.
    Implementations of MMIX might also emulate the process of virtual-address-to-physical-address translation
    described below, instead of providing for page table calculations in hardware. Then if, say, a LDB instruction
    does not know the physical memory address corresponding to a specified virtual address, it will cause a
    forced trap with the left half of rXX set to
    #03000000 and with rYY set to the virtual address in question.
    The trap handler should place the physical page address into rZZ; then RESUME 1 will complete the LDB.
</p>
<B id="dynamictrap">Dynamic TRAP</B>
<p>
    The third and final kind of interrupt is called a dynamic trap. Such interruptions occur when one or
    more of the 64 bits in the special interrupt request register rQ have been set to 1, and when at least one
    corresponding bit of the special interrupt mask register rK is also equal to 1. The bit positions of rQ and rK
    have the general form
</p>
<p>
<div ><img class="img-gitraptrip" src="../image/img-gitraptrip.png">
</div>
<p>

<p>
    Negative addresses are for the use of the operating system only; a security violation occurs if an instruction
    in a nonnegative address is executed without the rwxnkbsp bits of rK all set to 1. (In such cases the s bits
    of both rQ and rK are set to 1.)
    The eight "machine" bits of rQ and rK represent the most urgent kinds of interrupts. The rightmost
    bit stands for power failure, the next for memory parity error, the next for nonexistent memory, the next
    for rebooting, etc. Interrupts that need especially quick service, like requests from a high-speed network,
    also are allocated bit positions near the right end. Low priority I/O devices like keyboards are assigned to
    bits at the left. The allocation of input/output devices to bit positions will differ from implementation to
    implementation, depending on what devices are available.<br>
    Once rQ &and; rK becomes nonzero, the machine waits briefly until it can give a precise interrupt. Then it
    proceeds as with a forced trap, except that it uses the special "dynamic trap address register" rTT instead
    of rT. The trap handler that begins at location rTT can figure out the reason for interrupt by examining
    rQ &and; rK. (For example, after the instructions</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <i><a href="put.html">GET</a> $0,rQ; <a href="ldbu.html">LDOU</a> $1,savedK; <a href="logic.html">AND</a> $0,$0,$1; <a href="unsigned.html">SUBU</a> $1,$0,1; <a href="sadd.html">SADD</a> $2,$1,$0; <a href="logic.html">ANDN</a> $1,$0,$1</i>
</p>
<p>
    the highest-priority offending bit will be in $1 and its position will be in $2.)
    If the interrupted instruction contributed 1s to any of the rwxnkbsp bits of rQ, the corresponding bits
    are set to 1 also in rXX. A dynamic trap handler might be able to use this information (although it should
    service higher-priority interrupts first if the right half of rQ &and; rK is nonzero).
    The rules of MMIX are rigged so that only the operating system can execute instructions with interrupts
    suppressed. Therefore the operating system can in fact use instructions that would interrupt an ordinary
    program. Control of register rK turns out to be the ultimate privilege, and in a sense the only important
    one.
    An instruction that causes a dynamic trap is usually executed before the interruption occurs. However,
    an instruction that traps with bits x, k, or b does nothing; a load instruction that traps with r or n loads
    zero; a store instruction that traps with any of rwxnkbsp stores nothing.</p>
<B id="resume">RESUME</B>
<p>
    After a trip handler or trap handler has done its thing, it generally invokes the following command.
    <a href="resume.html">RESUME</a> Z <i>"resume after interrupt"</i>; the X and Y fields must be zero.
    If the Z field of this instruction is zero, MMIX will use the information found in special registers rW, rX, rY,
    and rZ to restart an interrupted computation. If the execution register rX is negative, it will be ignored and
    instructions will be executed starting at virtual address rW; otherwise the instruction in the right half of
    the execution register will be inserted into the program as if it had appeared in location rW - 4, subject to
    certain modifications that we will explain momentarily, and the next instruction will come from rW.
    If the Z field of RESUME is 1 and if this instruction appears in a negative location, registers rWW, rXX,
    rYY, and rZZ are used instead of rW, rX, rY, and rZ. Also, just before resuming the computation, mask
    register rK is set to $255 and $255 is set to rBB. (Only the operating system gets to use this feature.)
    An interrupt handler within the operating system might choose to allow itself to be interrupted. In such
    cases it should save the contents of rBB, rWW, rXX, rYY, and rZZ on some kind of stack, before making rK
    nonzero. Then, before resuming whatever caused the base level interrupt, it must again disable all interrupts;
    this can be done with TRAP, because the trap handler can tell from the virtual address in rWW that it has
    been invoked by the operating system. Once rK is again zero, the contents of rBB, rWW, rXX, rYY, and rZZ
    are restored from the stack, the outer level interrupt mask is placed in $255, and RESUME 1 finishes the job.
    Values of Z greater than 1 are reserved for possible later definition. Therefore they cause an illegal
    instruction interrupt (that is, they set the "b" bit of rQ) in the present version of MMIX.<br>
    If the execution register rX is nonnegative, its leftmost byte controls the way its right-hand half will be
    inserted into the program. Let's call this byte the "ropcode." A ropcode of 0 simply inserts the instruction
    into the execution stream; a ropcode of 1 is similar, but it substitutes rY and rZ for the two operands,
    assuming that this makes sense for the operation considered.<br>
    Ropcode 2 inserts a command that sets $X to rZ, where X is the second byte in the right half of rX.
    This ropcode is normally used with forced-trap emulations, so that the result of an emulated instruction is
    placed into the correct register. It also uses the third-from-left byte of rX to raise any or all of the arithmetic
    exceptions DVWIOUZX, at the same time as rZ is being placed in $X. Emulated instructions and explicit
    TRAP commands can therefore cause overflow, say, just as ordinary instructions can. (Such new exceptions
    may, of course, spawn a trip interrupt, if any of the corresponding bits are enabled in rA.)
    Finally, ropcode 3 is the same as ropcode 0, except that it also tells MMIX to treat rZ as the page table
    entry for the virtual address rY. Ropcodes greater
    than 3 are not permitted; moreover, only RESUME 1 is allowed to use ropcode 3.
    The ropcode rules in the previous paragraphs should of course be understood to involve rWW, rXX, rYY,
    and rZZ instead of rW, rX, rY, and rZ when the ropcode is seen by RESUME 1. Thus, in particular, ropcode 3
    always applies to rYY and rZZ, never to rY and rZ.
    Special restrictions must hold if resumption is to work properly: Ropcodes 0 and 3 must not insert a
    RESUME instruction; ropcode 1 must insert a "normal" instruction, namely one whose opcode begins with
    one of the hexadecimal digits
    
    #0,
    
    #1,
    
    #2,
    
    #3,
    
    #6,
    
    #7,
    
    #C,
    
    #D, or
    #E. (See the opcode chart below.) Some
    implementations may also allow ropcode 1 with SYNCD[I] and SYNCID[I], so that those instructions can
    conveniently be interrupted. Moreover, the destination register $X used with ropcode 1 or 2 must not be
    marginal. All of these restrictions hold automatically in normal use; they are relevant only if the programmer
    tries to do something tricky.
    Notice that the slightly tricky sequence</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        <i><a href="lda.html">LDA</a> $0,Loc; <a href="put.html">PUT</a> rW,$0; LDTU $1,Inst; <a href="put.html">PUT</a> rX,$1; <a href="resume.html">RESUME</a></i>
    </p>
    <p>
    will execute an almost arbitrary instruction Inst as if it had been in location Loc-4, and then will jump to
    location Loc (assuming that Inst doesn't branch elsewhere).
