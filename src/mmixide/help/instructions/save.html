    <p>
        Saves and restore the process state in the register stack.
    <p>
    <table  border=1 cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
        <tr><td>SAVE | UNSAVE:</td><td><i>"save process state" | "restore process state" (the Y field must be 0, and so must
                the Z field of SAVE, the X field of UNSAVE.)</i><br><br>
                
                The SAVE instruction stores all registers and special registers that might affect the computation of the
                currently running process. First the current local registers $0, $1, . . . , $(L - 1) are pushed down as in
                PUSHGO $255, and L is set to zero. Then the current global registers $G, $(G+1), . . . , $255 are placed above
                them in the register stack; finally rB, rD, rE, rH, rJ, rM, rR, rP, rW, rX, rY, and rZ are placed at the very
                top, followed by registers rG and rA packed into eight bytes:<br><br>
                
                <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-save" src="../image/img-save.png"></div><br><br>
                The address of the topmost octabyte is then placed in register $X, which must be a global register. (This
                instruction is interruptible. If an interrupt occurs while the registers are being saved, we will have &alpha; = &beta; = &gamma;
                in the ring of local registers; thus rO will equal rS and rL will be zero. The interrupt handler essentially has
                a new register stack, starting on top of the partially saved context.) Immediately after a SAVE the values
                of rO and rS are equal to the location of the first byte following the stack just saved. The current register
                stack is effectively empty at this point; thus one shouldn't do a POP until this context or some other context
                has been unsaved.
                The UNSAVE instruction goes the other way, restoring all the registers when given an address in register $Z
                that was returned by a previous SAVE. Immediately after an UNSAVE the values of rO and rS will be equal.
                Like SAVE, this instruction is interruptible.
                The operating system uses SAVE and UNSAVE to switch context between different processes. It can also
                use UNSAVE to establish suitable initial values of rO and rS. But a user program that knows what it is doing
                can in fact allocate its own register stack or stacks and do its own process switching.<br><br>
                <b>Caution</b>: UNSAVE is destructive, in the sense that a program can't reliably UNSAVE twice from the same
                saved context. Once an UNSAVE has been done, further operations are likely to change the memory record of
                what was saved. Moreover, an interrupt during the middle of an UNSAVE may have already clobbered some
                of the data in memory before the UNSAVE has completely finished, although the data will appear properly in
                all registers.
