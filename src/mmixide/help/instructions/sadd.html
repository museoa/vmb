        <B>Description:</B>
    <p>
        This instruction (Sideways Add) 
        counts the number of bit positions in which $y has a 1 and $Z has a 0.
        The result is stored in $X.
    <p>
    <table border=1 cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">

        <tr><td>SADD:</td> <td>Each bit of register $Y is logically anded with the complement of the corresponding bit of register $Z or of
                the constant Z, and the number of 1 bits in the result is placed in register $X. In other words, register $X is
                set to the number of bit positions in which register $Y has a 1 and the other operand has a 0; in symbols,
                $X = &upsilon;($Y \ $Z) or $X = &upsilon;($Y \ Z). When the second operand is zero this operation is sometimes called
                “population counting,” because it counts the number of 1s in register Y.</td></tr>
