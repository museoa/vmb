        Unconditional jump to Address $Y+$Z, respectively $Y+Z.
        The target address is rounded down to a multiple of 4.
        The address of the next instruction is stored as return address in $X.
        The instruction can be used to link subroutines or coroutines.

        <tr><td>GO:</td> <td>MMIX takes its next instruction from location $Y + $Z or $Y + Z, and continues from there. Register $X is
                set equal to &lambda; + 4, the location of the instruction that would ordinarily have been executed next. (GO is
                similar to a jump, but it is not relative to the current location. Since GO has the same format as a load or
                store instruction, a loading routine can treat program labels with the same mechanism that is used to treat
                references to data.)</br></br>
                An old-fashioned type of subroutine linkage can be implemented by saying either "GO r,subloc,0" or
                "<a href="geta.html">GETA</a> r,@+8; JMP Sub" (The Symbol @ is interpreted by the assembler as an abbreviation for "the location of the current instruction.")  to enter a subroutine, then "GO r,r,0" to return. But subroutines are normally
                entered with the instructions <a href="pushj.html">PUSHJ</a> or <a href="pushj.html">PUSHGO</a>.
                The two least significant bits of the address in a GO command are essentially ignored. They will, however,
                appear in the value of &lambda; returned by GETA instructions, and in the return-jump register rJ after <a href="pushj.html">PUSHJ</a>
                or <a href="pushj.html">PUSHGO</a> instructions are performed, and in the where-interrupted register at the time of an interrupt.
                Therefore they could be used to send some kind of signal to a subroutine or (less likely) to an interrupt
                handler.</td>
