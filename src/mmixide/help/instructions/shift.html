        <B>Description:</B>
    <p>
        SL shifts the bits in register $Y left.
        If bits unequal to the sign bit of $Y are shifted out during
        this process, an overflow is signaled. The result is filled with 0 bits from the right.

        SLU has the same effect but never causes overflow.
    <p>
        SR shifts the bits in register $Y to the right.
        It fills the target register from the left by replicating the sign bit and discards
        bits on the right; SRU fills the target register from the left with zeros.
    <p>
    <table border=1 cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">

        <tr><td>SL:</td> <td>The bits of register $Y are shifted left by $Z or Z places, and 0s are shifted in from the right; the result is
                placed in register $X. Register $Y is treated as a signed number, but the second operand is treated as an
                unsigned number. The effect is the same as multiplication by 2<sup>$Z</sup> or by 2<sup>Z</sup>; an integer overflow exception
                occurs if the result is - 2<sup>63</sup>
                or < -2<sup>63</sup>. In particular, if the second operand is 64 or more, register $X will
                become entirely zero, and integer overflow will be signaled unless register Y was zero.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SLU: </td><td> The bits of register $Y are shifted left by $Z or Z places, and 0s are shifted in from the right; the result is
                placed in register $X. Both operands are treated as unsigned numbers. The SLU instructions are equivalent
                to SL, except that no test for overflow is made.
            </td></tr>
        <tr><td>SR:</td><td> The bits of register Y are shifted right by $Z or Z places, and copies of the leftmost bit (the sign bit) are
                shifted in from the left; the result is placed in register X. Register Y is treated as a signed number, but the
                second operand is treated as an unsigned number. The effect is the same as division by 2<sup>$Z</sup> or by 2<sup>Z</sup>
                and rounding down. In particular, if the second operand is 64 or more, register $X will become zero if $Y was
                nonnegative, -1 if $Y was negative.
            </td></tr>
        <tr><td>SRU:</td> <td>The bits of register $Y are shifted right by $Z or Z places, and 0s are shifted in from the left; the result is
                placed in register $X. Both operands are treated as unsigned numbers. The effect is the same as unsigned
                division of a 64-bit number by 2<sup>$Z</sup> or by 2<sup>Z</sup>; 
                if the second operand is 64 or more, register $X will become
                entirely zero.
