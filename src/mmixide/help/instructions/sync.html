    <p>
        Needed to synchronize processes.
        XYZ has a value from 0 to 7, where values greater 3 are reserved for the
        operating system.<br><br>
        Of course no SYNC is necessary between a command that loads from or stores into memory and a subsequent
        command that loads from or stores into exactly the same location. However, SYNC might be necessary in
        certain cases even on a one-processor system, because input/output processes take place in parallel with
        ordinary computation.<br>
        The cases XYZ > 3 are privileged, in the sense that only the operating system can use them. More
        precisely, if a SYNC command is encountered with XYZ = 4 or XYZ = 5 or XYZ = 6 or XYZ = 7, a
        "privileged instruction interrupt" occurs unless that interrupt is currently disabled. Only the operating
        system can disable interrupts

                            instructions preceding this SYNC will be completed before all store instructions after it. </td></tr>

                            and cleans its data caches, if any (including a possible secondary cache); the caches retain their data, but the
                            cache contents also appear in memory.  </td></tr>

                            the data caches that wasn't previously in memory. ("Clearing" is stronger than "cleaning"; a clear cache
                            remembers nothing. Clearing is also faster, because it simply obliterates everything.)</td></tr>
