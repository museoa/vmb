		<p>The ROM device offers a variable amount of read only memory at a configurable address.  The content of the memory is taken form an image file. Any type of file can be used as an image file, as the file is just placed into memory and mapped into the address space. The maximum file size is 4GByte. The actual size depends on the size of the image file. The size of the image file is rounded up to multiples of 1 kByte. Upon Power On or Reset,  the ROM image file is reread to update the ROM in case of changes were made to the image file.</p>
