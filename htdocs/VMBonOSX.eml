Subject: VMB on OS X
From: Joel Heikkila
To: ruckert@cs.hm.edu

Hello,

I hope I have the right person and address for this. I tried to build
VMB version 1.3 under OS X 10.8 and it failed.

It took two small changes to the source to build mother/ and util/
without errors, which I have included as a patch.

clock_gettime does not exist on Mac OS X (despite being mandated in
POSIX) so I wrote a quick replacement, although precise timings may be
off since its accurate only to usec precision.

terminate_flag was declared extern within a ifdef for WIN32 in
mother/mother.c, making it break on non-Windows, so there's that too.

mmix/ was missing several .c source files and the Makefile was
assuming the CWEB files to be available.  I commented out those
targets to regenerate the .c source and copied the generated .c files
from the current MMIX distribution over to vmb/mmix/ which allowed it
to build since that seems to be the practice preferred for VMB.  The
missing files were abstime.c mmix-arith.c mmotype.c .

vmb/mmix/ also tries to link against librt, which doesn't exist on OS
X.  It does build without any linking errors without that, though.

At that point, I get a number of:

ERROR (rom, 120): Locking event mutex failed
ERROR (ram, 120): Locking event mutex failed
ERROR (screen, 120): Locking event mutex failed
Power...ERROR (MMIX CPU, 98): Locking event mutex failed
...

errors and getting to the bottom of that is out of my depth though
I'll let you know if I make any progress.  I hope it's not librt or my
clock_gettime changes!

So, it compiles, but doesn't run.

Hope this helps at least somewhat,

Joel Heikkila
