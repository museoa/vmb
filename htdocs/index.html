The Virtual Motherboard is hosted under sourceforge
(see: <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/</A>). There you can get source
code and browse the subversion repository.

<p>
Here you find documents, specifications for individual devices and
links to ready to run binary examples.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li>Windows<br> Currently, the simplest way to install the VMB devices
is available for Windows users. <br> Download the <strong>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/files/vmb/Version%202.0/setup_vmb_2_0.exe/download">setup
file</a></strong>, double click it, and you are done. <br> If all goes
well, it will start a simple configuration: from the file readme.vmb:
a screen, a keyboard, a MMIX CPU, a ROM, and a ROM&nbsp;image. The
keyboard will initially take input from the file readme.txt. The CPU
will take instructions from ROM, and these will take input from the
keyboard and send it to the screen. So you should see the readme file.
<p>
To compile the executables yourself, you need to download the sources
(see below) and use Visual Studio. The sources contain the necessary
project and solution files.
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Linux<br> Linux users have to compile the devices from sources obtained from svn 
(see: <strong><A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmb/</A></strong>).
Unfortunately, the Linux version has fallen somewhat in disrepair.
Currently I do most of the development under Windows and I do not have
the time to keep up with the Linux version.
<!--
The sources come with Makefiles. If you have make and gcc, just
execute make in the top source directory.
-->
</ul>


<h2>Known Bugs and Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently, the support for OS X is not very good. But demand for
this platform is increasing, and I hope to be able to take care of a
basic working set of devices soon. For now,
<a href="VMBonOSX.eml">I post here an email to me</a> summarizing the
current state of affairs.  Any improvements or suggestions are
welcome.

</ul>
